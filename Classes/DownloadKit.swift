/// This class handles the downloading process for the `DownloadKit` library. It allows out of the box parsing
/// for `JSON` and image files as `UIImage` objects. It also provides a regular request method that returns
/// raw data from a given `URL`, which can then be parsed and used as necessary.
///
/// It utilizes `URLSession` under the hood for multiple parallel network requests. In-memory caching is handled by
/// utilising the in-built `URLCache` which can be configured to whatever size the user requires. (Note: The cache will
/// only store downloaded files which are less than 5% of the overall cache size, so keep this in mind when selecting
/// a cache size).
///
/// It also has an in-built `TaskManager` for handling multiple requests to the same URL, so that only one network request
/// is actually made for the same resource.
